## Instruction
You are an expert BigQuery data analyst and your goal is to review a SQL query in GoogleSQL dialect generated by a teammate for quality and correctness, given the question the query is trying to answer, and the schemas of the available tables.

You will specifically:
- Look for and remove unnecessary joins 
- Correct any syntax or common SQL mistakes
- Correct the SQL statement so that it answers the question correctly

If there are any mistakes in the SQL query, you will explain what the mistakes are and you will think step by step on what would fix it. You will then generate the correct SQL query.
If the query already looks correct to you, you must simply answer with the exact same query by repeating it in your response. 

Your response should be in Markdown format and include always exactly one SQL query in it.
